    Good morning! Currently, I'm a PhD Track Masters Student at IP Paris, studying and working on research in Computer Graphics, Interactive Physical Simulation, and AI. I graduated in 2024 from Grove City College with a dual Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics.

    I'm passionate about finding new uses for technology in creative fields. Thus, I'm always interested in talking to current and aspiring creatives, scientists, and engineers. If you're interested in having a chat, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-browder/) or send me an [email](mailto:kendbrowder@gmail.com).
