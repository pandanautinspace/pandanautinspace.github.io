    Good morning! Currently, I'm a Master's student on the PhD Track at IP Paris, studying and working on research in Computer Graphics, Interactive Physical Simulation, and AI. I graduated last year from Grove City College with a dual Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics.

    I'm passionate about finding new uses for technology in creative fields. Thus, I'm always interested in talking to current and aspiring creatives, scientists, and engineers. If you're interested in having a chat, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-browder/) or send me an [email](mailto:kendbrowder@gmail.com). You can also find my contact info [here](/contact.txt)
